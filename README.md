# World Continents, Countries, Cities, Languages and Timezones

This project uses an Parse App created at [Back4app](https://www.back4app.com), which has a free, public database connected from the [Database Hub](https://www.back4app.com/database) containing the [World Continents, Countries, Cities, Languages and Timezones](https://www.back4app.com/database/back4app/list-of-all-continents-countries-cities) to make a few queries and demonstrate data usage.

Use this App as you'd like. It is free to use and distribute.

## Prerequisites

This program is writen in [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org), which is a Javascript runtime, therefore, familiarity with Javascript is required.

It will be necessary to use the Parse SDK for Javascript (Node.JS) to run this project.
For your convenience, the Parse SDK for Javascript is already built in this project.

If you wish to reinstal it, the easiest way is to use the [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/).

If your system already has[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed, just run this command:

   $ npm install parse

All the documentation about the Javascript SDK canb e found in the [Javascript Docs](https://www.back4app.com/docs/javascript/parse-javascript-sdk).


## Running the program

To run the program, just run this command from the directory where the project was cloned/decompressed:

  $ node index.js
